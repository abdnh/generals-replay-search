This is a work-in-progress Python project to make it easier to view information about game replays of [Command & Conquer: Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Generals) and [Command & Conquer: Generals â€“ Zero Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Generals_%E2%80%93_Zero_Hour) and search for relevant replays. Inspired by the old RepInfo tool.

## Roadmap

-   [x] Replay file parsing
-   [x] [Gentool](https://www.gentool.net/) data downloader
-   [x] SQLite database
-   [ ] Graphical interface and search features
